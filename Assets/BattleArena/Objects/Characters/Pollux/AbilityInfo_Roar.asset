  m_description: 'Shouts profanity in a very aggressive and mean way destroying projectiles
    along its path and dealing damage. Ouch! Talk about feelings!


    - I got the
    eye of the tiger, a fighter

    Dancing through the fire

''    Cause I am
    a champion, and you''re gonna hear me roar

    Louder, louder than a lion

''    Cause
    I am a champion, and you''re gonna hear me roar'
